## Architecture

### Backend Structure
The backend is organized into several key components:

```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                 # AI Agents and Processing Modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input/             # Input Speech processing and validation using Google 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model/             # ML models and algorithms
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orchestrator/      # Workflow orchestration and coordination
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mcp/              # Master Control Program for agent management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ outils/           # Utility functions and helper tools
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ output/           # Output processing and formatting
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/            # Test suites and validation
```

### Component Descriptions

#### Agents Module
- **Input**: Handles data ingestion, validation, and preprocessing
- **Model**: Contains machine learning models for personalization and prediction
- **Orchestrator**: Manages workflow and coordinates between different agents
- **MCP**: Master Control Program that oversees agent operations
- **Outils**: Shared utilities and helper functions
- **Output**: Processes and formats results for frontend consumption

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual Environment (venv)
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weppo.git
cd weppo
```

2. Set up virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Running the WebSocket Server Example

The `websocket_server.py` located in `backend/agents/input/` provides a demonstration of real-time audio processing and interaction with the AI agent. To run this example:

1.  **Start the Server**:
    Run the Python script directly:
    ```bash
    python backend/agents/input/websocket_server.py
    ```
    You should see a message indicating the server has started, typically on `ws://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Use the Example Client**:
    Open the `example/file.html` file in your web browser.
    This HTML page provides a user interface to:
    *   Connect to the WebSocket server.
    *   Initiate a "call" to the agent.
    *   Stream audio from your microphone.
    *   View transcriptions of your speech.
    *   See and hear the agent's responses.

    Make sure your browser has permission to access your microphone.
